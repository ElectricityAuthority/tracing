      "This notebook provides the python code used to determine estimated Regulated Asset Base (RAB) values for each transmission asset that is flow traced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transpowers RAB is contained in the 2014 Grid.xlsx file with all Connection Asset information set to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transpowers RAB has values of transmission lines and substations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Transmission lines\n",
      "\n",
      "Allocating the RAB on the flow tracing results causes a mapping problem in that Transpowers assets are valued on an overall asset base, while flow tracing works at the electrical level.  For example, a trasmission line can consist of many different circuits.  The CHH-TWZ-A double circuit transmission line has one value in the RAB, yet is traced over many different electrical circuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The file RAB_electrical_mapping.csv contains the mapping between the physical asset in the RAB and the electical circuits that are traced.  It includes the estimated length of each of the circuits so that the single RAB value can be pro-rated amoung it's electrical circuits.  \n",
      "\n",
      "An example follows for the CHH_TWZ transmission line:\n",
      "```\n",
      " line     , circuits       , length , sub1    , sub2\n",
      " CHH_TWZA , ASB_TIM_TWZ1.3 , 74.95  , OPI2202 , TWZ2201\n",
      " CHH_TWZA , ASB_TIM_TWZ2.3 , 74.95  , OPI2201 , TWZ2201\n",
      " CHH_TWZA , ASB_TIM_TWZ1.1 , 69.2   , ASB2201 , OPI2202\n",
      " CHH_TWZA , ASB_TIM_TWZ2.1 , 69.2   , ASB2201 , OPI2201\n",
      " CHH_TWZA , ASB_ISL1.1     , 72.2   , ISL2201 , ASB2201\n",
      " CHH_TWZA , ASB_BRY.1      , 72.2   , BRY2201 , ASB2201\n",
      "```\n",
      "Several assumptions are made, including a mapping from physical assets to electrical assets based on estimated circuit length.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single electrical circuit might be made from multiple RAB assets.  The ARI_BOB1.1 circuit is a 110kV transmission line that is estimated to be mapped over three RAB assets.\n",
      "```\n",
      " line     , circuits   , length , sub1    , sub2\n",
      " ARI_HAMA , ARI_BOB1.1 , 47     , BOB1101 , ARI1101\n",

      " HAM_MERA , ARI_BOB1.1 , 39.6   , BOB1101 , ARI1101\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Some differences in RAB values between what has been previously published and what appears here are due to the zeroing of connection assets.  For example, the BOB_MERA transmission line is considered a connection asset in Transpowers RAB spreadsheet and its value is therefore not included in this published code.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Substations\n",
      "\n",
      "Substations include the cost of switchgear.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Transformers\n",
